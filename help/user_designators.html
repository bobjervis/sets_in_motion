<h1>Designator Editor</h1>
<p>The sub-window that you use to describe the meaning of a dancer designator phrase is called the Designator Editor.</p>

   <p>
        <img align=right src=designator_editor_locked.png />At right you can see an image
       of the Designator Editor, showing the definition for the phrase "ANYONE and ANYONE",
       as in 'head boys and side girls'.&nbsp; This is how it will appear when the grammar
       is locked to prevent accidental editing.&nbsp; The expression (if you are familiar
       with programming) is the logical OR of each sub-phrase.&nbsp; In other words, "ANYONE
       and ANYONE" describes the group of dancers who are described by either or both of
       the sub-phrases.&nbsp; For example, "heads and girls" includes the three distinct
       groups of the head boys, the head girls and the side girls.<p>
           The date the phrase was created and last modified appears for reference.</p>
       <p>
           If you see a level in the box, then the given phrase is only allowed at that level
           and above.&nbsp; This example, does not have any restrictions on the dance level
           where you can use it.&nbsp; The phrases "beaus" and "belles" are restricted, for
           example, to the Advanced level only.</p>
       <p><img align=left src=designator_editor_unlocked.png />If the grammar can be edited then the editor will have the appearance of the image at the left.&nbsp; This image
           illustrates the Designator Editor with the definition for "Beaus" loaded.&nbsp;
           Note that the level has been set to "Advanced-1".&nbsp; You can click inside the
           field with the phrase "beaus" written in ti if you want to modify that phrase.&nbsp;
           The empty field below it can be used to type in a new synonymous phrase.&nbsp; As
           in phrases for call definitions, you can have different numbers of words in each
           phrase, as long as the built-in pattern words, such as ANYONE, are the same and
           appear in the same order in each phrase.</p>
       <p>
           For designator phrases, you cannot use the built-in terms ANYTHING or ANYCALL.&nbsp;
           Most commonly, you can use ANYONE to build up compound dancer designations.</p>
       <p>
           To delete a phrase, just erase the text on its line.&nbsp; The next time the grammar
           is saved and re-loaded into the program, blank lines will be removed.</p>
       <p>
           Note that the same word "beaus" appears both in the phrase and in the expression.&nbsp;
           That is because "beaus", like a handful of other basic square dance terms are pre-defined
           by the program and will be interpreted according to the built-in definition in the
           program.&nbsp; Caution: do not remove or change the phrase for each of the built-in
           terms that matches the expression. Some standard definitions rely on the meaning
           of those terms and changing them may have unpredictable results.&nbsp; Also, due
           to subtleties of the grammar, in some contexts the original meaning will still be
           used (as in the expressions of a designator definition).&nbsp;
