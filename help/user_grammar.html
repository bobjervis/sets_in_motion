<h1>Grammar Editor</h1>
    <p>
        The sub-window that gives you the top-level view of a definitions file is called
        a Grammar Editor (since this allows you to define vocabulary, synonyms and valid
        phrases for use in calls).&nbsp; The Grammar Editor is shown as an outline.<img align=right src=grammar_editor_top.png />&nbsp;
        The image at right shows how this outline appears when you have closed all the outline
        items except the top-level filename line itself.&nbsp; As you can see, small boxes
        contain either a minus or plus sign.&nbsp; Each such box can be clicked to alter
        how the outline is displayed.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking on a minus box will close that item and contract everything under it.&nbsp;
        The box itself then changes into a plus box.&nbsp; Clicking on a plus box will expand
        the underlying outline items and change the box to a minus box.</p>
    <p>
        If no further outline items exist under a given level, no box will be drawn next
        to the item.&nbsp; Currently, each synonym, definition and formation are the lowest
        levels of this outline.</p>
    <p>
        Currently there is nothing you can do with synonyms, formations or dancer designations.&nbsp;
        This will be remedied in a future release.</p>
    <p>
        <img align=right src=grammar_editor_defs.png />When you expand outline, if there is not enough room, scrollbars will be included
        to allow you to adjust the portion
        of the list that is visible.</p>
    <p>
        The definitions are labeled with the first phrase used to call that definition.&nbsp;
        As you change the phrases for a call, the list of definitions will not be re-sorted
        until you re-start the program.</p>
    <p>
        If you right-click on the title 'Definitions' it offers you a menu with a single
        item on it: Create New Definition.&nbsp; Selecting that menu item will create a
        new definition that is completely empty and ready to be filled in.&nbsp; It is added
        to the end of the list of definitions in the current file.&nbsp; The definition
        will be opened in a Definition Editor in the left-hand side of the main window,
        covering the outline view.&nbsp; You can return to the outline by clicking on the
        tab marked either 'Definitions' or 'My Definitions' (depending on which you want
        to see).</p>
    <p>
        If you click on a definition in the outline, a Definition Editor for that call will
        be opened in the left-hand pane of the main window.</p>
    <p>
        Notice that in the default Definitions list, most words are in lower case.&nbsp;
        As a convention to help read the definitions, I capitalize built-in terms like FRACTION
        or P_C.&nbsp; As noted elsewhere, the program is not case sensitive, so you do not
        have to follow this convention if you prefer to write your definitions differently.&nbsp;
        The exact capitalization is only used in displaying the name of a call back to you.</p>
