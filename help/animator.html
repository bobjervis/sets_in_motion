<h1>Animations</h1>
    <p>
        The sub-window that you can use to view an animation of a sequence is the Animations
        view.&nbsp; It appears in the right-hand pane of the main window.</p>
    <p><img align=right src=animation_sample.png />The image at right shows an example
        of the Animations view.</p>
    <p>
        Dancers appear as blue squares (for boys) and pink circles (for girls).&nbsp; The
        number written in these figures is the couple nummber for the dancer.&nbsp; A small
        black semi-circle is drawn to indicate the location of the dancer's nose.</p>
    <p>
        As you resize the window, the size of the figures will change to fit the image to
        the available space.</p>
    <p>
        Across the top of the view, you will see a row of controls.</p>
    <p>
        On the far left as four buttons.&nbsp; They are marked using standard playback symbols.&nbsp;
        From left to right, they are 'rewind to the beginning', rewind one 'call', play/pause
        and forward one call.</p>
    <p>
        Note that the image on the play/pause button will change from <img src=animation_play.png /> when paused to
        <img src=animation_pause.png /> when playing.&nbsp; The visible symbol declares what pressing the button should
        do.</p>
    <p>
        To the right of the control buttons is a track with a circular green spot.&nbsp;
        This is a time scale.&nbsp; The location of the green spot marks the relative time
        within the total sequence that the image currently shows.&nbsp; You will see that
        this spot moves across the track as the animation plays.</p>
    <p>
        Note that pressing the rewind, back one call or forward one call buttons while the
        animation is playing does not cause it to pause.&nbsp; Thus, you can actively 'loop'
        the animation by repeatedly playing the back or rewind buttons.</p>
    <p>
        To the right of the time track is a set of radio-buttons.&nbsp; Click on one of
        the circles to select the speed you want to play the animation.&nbsp; The program
        will remember the speed setting.</p>
    <p>
        Slowest speed is about half that of Normal.&nbsp; Fastest speed is about twice that
        of Normal and the other speeds are intermediate between the extremes.&nbsp; Note
        that Normal speed is currently set to about 120 beats per minute.</p>
