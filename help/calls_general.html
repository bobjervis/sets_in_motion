<h1>
    Directional Calls</h1>
<p>
These topics are organized under the label attached to the call in the <em>Sets in Motion</em>
    database.</p>
<h3>ANYONE ANYTHING</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <div class=example_intro>Example:</div>
        <div class=example_instance>heads square thru 3</div>
        <div class=example_instance>trailers cross</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The ANYONE phrase designates some dancers.&nbsp; In some cases, such as for "centers"
        and "ends" or "leaders" and "trailers", no one may fit the designation in the current
        formation.&nbsp; If no dancers match the designation, the call fails.</p>
    <p>
        You can combine multiple ANYONE designations (since ANYTHING includes another ANYONE
        ANYTHING), such as "heads centers".&nbsp; In the future the more natural "head centers"
        or "center heads" would be preferred, but those more complex phrases are not yet
        recognized.&nbsp; If you do combine multiple designations, then only the dancers
        that satisfy all of the designations perform the call.</p>
    <p>
        My understanding is that when designating dancers as in this call, the call is performed
        as if all other dancers disappeared.&nbsp; Thus, when you are looking for partners,
        for example, for one of the designated dancers you only consider other designated
        dancers.&nbsp; It is important to realize that some calls include designating some
        dancers (such as "ANYONE run".&nbsp; In <em>Sets in Motion</em> there is no "run"
        call.&nbsp; So "boys run" is not an instance of ANYONE ANYTHING.&nbsp; It is a separate
        call where all dancers are potential partners for the designated runners.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        If you say "centers boys run", only the center boys may run and they must run around
        another center (because you are saying ANYONE ANYTHING with ANYONE being "centers"
        and ANYTHING being "boys run").&nbsp; If you say "center boys run" then you are
        saying&nbsp; ANYONE run with ANYONE being "center boys".&nbsp; If you called "center
        boys run" from lines or waves, the center boys would have to run around the nearest
        end dancer (their partner in the larger formation).&nbsp; Note that this early test
        version does not support a number of compound designations like "center boys", but
        will in the future.</p>
    <p>
        In most cases, this subtle distinction won't make any difference.&nbsp; But, as
        the previous example illustrates, when it does make a difference it can be important.</p>
    <p>
        Another example may be worth mentioning.&nbsp; If you have a wave with boys in the
        center and call "boys u-turn back", the boys must turn toward each other.&nbsp;
        The girls are not counted when looking for partners.&nbsp; If you said "u-turn back"
        in this situation, the boys' partners are the adjacent end dancers (the girls),
        and they would have to turn toward them.&nbsp; But once you designate anyone, that
        relationship no longer applies and you must look elsewhere for partners.</p>
    <p>
        The Squared Set Convention says that when designating dancers, such as "heads" or
        "sides" to do a move from a squared set, if the move cannot be done from the formation
        the dancers are in, then the designated dancers move into the middle and perform
        the call.&nbsp; Then, when done, if the active dancers are still facing the same
        wall as they started and didn't interact with the other dancers (so they are where
        they started), then the active dancers back out (or step forward as their facing
        dictates) to squared set positions.</p>
    <p>
        <em>Sets in Motion</em> implements the Squared Set Convention using some extra wording
        in this call.&nbsp; Since you can only trigger the Squared Set Convention by designating
        dancers, this is the best place to add the test.&nbsp; Essentially, if the basic
        move cannot be done, then the program tries the alternate (moving in before doing
        the call).&nbsp; Only if neither method succeeds will the overall call fail.</p>
    <p>
        Also note that the program only checks whether the dancers can start the call correctly.&nbsp;
        Any problems that develop after a dancer has actually moved may cause the call to
        fail (such as if the call eventually reaches a point where the dancers cannot finish).&nbsp;
        This reflects the fact that real dancers will commit themselves to a particular
        interpretation of the call and start moving without necessarily realizing that some
        later stage of the call will not work.&nbsp; I am not aware of a call that will
        fail in this way, but if you find a situation and disagree with the outcome, let
        me know.</p>
    <h3>ANYONE back away</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <div class=example_intro>Example:</div>
        <div class=example_instance>heads back away</div>
        <div class=example_instance>centers back away</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        This is directing the named dancers to back away from the center of the set.&nbsp;
        It requires that the designated dancers must be standing on one of the center four
        positions of a set.&nbsp; They must be facing the same set of walls (side or head
        walls) and the home positions just outside of them (e.g. side positions when facing side
        walls) must be unoccupied.&nbsp; The designated dancers will either step forward
        or back one full position to occupy the vacant home positions nearest them.</p>
    <h3>
        ANYONE move in</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <div class=example_intro>
            Example:</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            heads move in</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            sides move in</div>
    </div>
    <p>This directs the named dancers, who must be standing on home positions, to move
        into the middle.&nbsp; The named dancers must be facing in and the center positions
        immediately in front of them must be empty.</p>
    <h3>
        ANYTHING INTEGER times</h3>
    <h3>
        ANYTHING twice</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <div class=example_intro>
            Example:</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            circulate twice</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            in roll circulate 3 times</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        This simply repeats the indicated call the number of times specified.&nbsp; It accomplishes
        the same thing as writing the call that many times in a row.&nbsp; It is provided as a
        convenience.</p>
    <h3>
        FRACTION ANYTHING</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <div class=example_intro>
            Example:</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            1/2 swing thru</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            circulate 1 and 1/2</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Note that the fraction can be written as an improper fraction and may include whole
        number parts as well as fractions.&nbsp; The word and must appear between the whole
        number and fractional part of the phrase.&nbsp; This call executes the indicated
        fraction of the ANYTHING call.&nbsp; This fails if the call has a number of parts
        that is not compatible with the given fraction.&nbsp; Calls with only one part can
        only be fractionalized if the one part consists of a single call.&nbsp; If so, then
        the embedded call is fractionalized by the given amount.</p>
    <p>
        If a call contains a particular number of parts, such as 3, then any fraction that
        is expressed as thirds or any multiple of thirds (as in 2/6) will succeed.&nbsp;
        As an additional convenience, if the fraction is not exact to the number of parts
        in the call, as in using 1/2 for a three part call, then as many parts as the fraction
        allows will be performed and the remaining part of the fraction is then applied
        to the next part.&nbsp; For example, if you call "1/2 remake", which is a three
        part call, then the first part and half of the second part is performed.</p>
    <p>
        Note also that if the indicated part is a primitive, some primitives may allow further
        fractionalization while others do not.&nbsp; For example, trade from a mini-wave
        is written as an <strong>$arc</strong> primitive.&nbsp; This primitive can be broken
        down as far as 1/4 turns only.&nbsp; Since a trade is written (in this formation)
        as an <strong>$arc</strong> 1/2, you can call "1/2 trade" since that will turn the
        <strong>$arc</strong> fraction from 1/2 to 1/4 and still be a valid move.&nbsp;
        If you tried to call "1/3 trade", however, your call would fail because you cannot
        turn 1/6 of a circle.</p>
    <h3>
        ANYTHING and ANYCALL</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <div class=example_intro>
            Example:</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            boys trade and roll</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            square thru and trade by<br />
            centers trade and pass thru</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Primarily, this call performs the first listed call and then the second.&nbsp; If
        your first call of the pair designates some dancers, then only the active dancers
        perform the second call.&nbsp; Also, be aware that you are not re-applying the designator
        for the second call.&nbsp; A call like "leaders u-turn back and circulate" is not
        the same as "leaders u-turn back and leaders circulate".&nbsp; In the first instance,
        the 'leaders' designate whatever dancers apply.&nbsp; Even if they are no longer
        leaders (as u-turn back will typically turn leaders into trailers), they are still
        the active dancers and will perform the circulate.&nbsp; In the second case, only
        those active dancers that remained leaders will do the circulate.</p>
    <p>
        <em>Sets in Motion</em> uses the term 'ANYCALL' as the second part of this compound
        call as a syntactic way to describe how concepts such as "as couples" are applied.&nbsp;
        Almost all calls are counted by the program as instances of ANYTHING.&nbsp; The
        exception is any call that begins with ANYTHING itself.&nbsp; Calls whose phrases
        begin with ANYTHING, such as "ANYTHING twice" are counted as instances of ANYCALL.</p>
    <p>
        When you say "as couples trade and roll", it is my understanding that the 'as couples'
        concept only applies to the first call, not to the roll.&nbsp; There are those who
        believe that this is not true and a call such as this means that the roll should
        be done 'as couples' as well.&nbsp; Because of this difference of opinion, some
        callers recommend saying "as couples trade and individually roll" versus "as couples
        trade and as couples roll" in every case where there might be confusion.&nbsp; <em>Sets
            in Motion</em> requires that you say "as couples trade and as couples roll"
        to get the roll done 'as couples'.&nbsp; In the future, this may well become a selectable
        preference.</p>
    <h3><a id=adjust_to_a_box />
        adjust to a box</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <div class=example_intro>
            Example:</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            pass the ocean;
            ends fold; adjust to a box</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            centers cross fold; adjust to a box</div>
    </div>
    <p>From a Z, dancers move either forward or back to form a box.</p>
    <p>
        From two twosomes separated by two phantoms (as might arise after a fold or cross-fold
        call), the twosome slide laterally together to make a box.</p>
    <h3>
        check a ring</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <div class=example_intro>
            Example:</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            check a ring; swing thru</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            check a ring; girls run right</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        From a squared set, this call moves the dancers slightly and arranges them into
        an alamo ring.&nbsp; For example, the call "swing thru" is not defined from a squared
        set.&nbsp; However, I believe that it is acceptable to direct dancers in a squared
        set to join hands in a ring so that you can then call "swing thru".&nbsp; Otherwise,
        you would have to use the rather absurd looking "circle left 0/4" which seems far
        from obvious.</p>
    <h3>
        those who can ANYTHING</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <div class=example_intro>
            Example:</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            those who can left turn 1/4</div>
        <div class=example_instance>
            those who can touch 1/4</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The phrase "those who can" should probably be considered a variation of "ANYONE".&nbsp;
        Unlike phrases like "head boys" which always name the same dancers or "leaders"
        which name dancers in the current formation on the floor, "those who can" depends
        entirely on what the call does to figure out who is designated.&nbsp; Therefore,
        it is easier to define this phrase as a separate call, rather than try and make
        it an ANYONE phrase.</p>
    <p>
        <em>Sets in Motion</em> will try every combination of dancers and every possible
        starting formation to get the most number of dancers doing the call.&nbsp; It will
        succeed if any or all of the dancers can be grouped to do the call.&nbsp; It will
        fail if no one can do the call.&nbsp; It will also fail if there is more than one
        way to get the maximum number of dancers involved.&nbsp; For example, "those who
        can trade" in an in-facing ring of 8 will fail if the dancers are not arranged with
        alternating man-woman.&nbsp; Since a couple is any two adjacent dancers with the
        same facing, if the dancers are boy-boy-girl-girl, you could make same-sex pairs
        or boy-girl pairs and still have all 8 dancers trading.</p>
