<h1>Sets In Motion</h1>
<h2>Square Dance Choreography</h2>
<p><i>Sets in Motion</i> is a program for anyone interested in creating or understanding 
Western Square Dance choreography.  
It allows you to create sequences of Square Dance calls and then watch figures animate the motions dancers
would go through to perform those calls.
It also analyses aspects of those moves to help identify potential problems dancers might have.
If you have questions about why a particular move is performed a certain way, the program also lets you drill into 
the details of how each step of a complicated call has to be performed.</p>
<p>The current program is still early in development.
These pages of documentation are intended to get you started in using a test version of the program.
If you have a copy, I hope you are willing to give feedback to help imrpove the program.

    I created this program to help me understand square dancing.
    I hope that it helps you to do so as well.

    <p>
    Square dancing has a complex jargon for describing dancer
    movements.
    This language is special purpose.
    You can't write a novel in it, but you can describe some
    intricate arrangements of turns and weaves and that's been enough
    to entertain lots of people for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
    No one person invented this language.
    Like any human jargon, it arose from the day-to-day practice
    of square dance callers.
    Some phrases and terms are quite old, but much of the present
    richness of expression emerged between 1950 and 1970 as a generation
    of inventive callers and growing crowds of dancers built square
    dancing as we now know it.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have been dancing several nights a week for most of the last 25 years.
    Over time, I've been impressed with how many fundamental concepts are
    not well described, and often are poorly understood and incorrectly
    danced.
    Nevertheless, as a group square dancers routinely gather to dance to
    complex choreography composed by hundreds of different callers and we
    generally agree on what should be done.
    For all the nits at the fringes, there is a broad consensus on the
    correct way to square dance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Since I am a professional computer progammer and have been for far
    longer than I have square danced, I have been fascinated with the
    simulation of square dancing on computer.
    I've used the SD square dance program for six years now to write
    material for my own calling and it is remarkable what it gets right
    as well as where it can be frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have always wanted a program that would be able to tell me when
    I am making some common errors in calling that are not generally caught by
    current programs.
    When callers first started writing prepared material, they used checkers,
    dolls or other physical devices to stand for the dancers.&nbsp; That was an incredibly tedious
        and error-prone way to compose dances.&nbsp; Several existing programs permit you
        to pick calls and instantly see the correct outcome. What these programs generally
        lack is any feedback on how the dancers had to move to accomplish the calls just
        entered.&nbsp; As anyone who has experienced bad choreography can attest, there
        are perfectly legal ways to string calls together that are just not fun to dance.&nbsp;
        Some of those problems can be detected by careful analysis of the prescribed motions.&nbsp;
        For example, excessively turning a dancer in the same direction causes dizziness.&nbsp;
        Some people are more sensitive than others, but your inner ear responds predictably
        to turning motions of the head and body.&nbsp; This program actually calculates
        turning motion in order to produce the animations.</p>
    <p>
        Another desire when I started this project was to create call definitions that can
        be easily compared to the original definition.&nbsp; Many definitions of square
        dance calls are worded vaguely or do not include starting formations that are routinely
        used by callers and well understood by dancers.&nbsp; As a result, it isn't always
        possible to create definitions that match exactly what is written in a Callerlab
        document.&nbsp; Much of the general procedure, for example, for performing calls
        and making adjustments is simply not written anywhere.&nbsp; Callerlab, for example,
        has nothing in their documents to describe "breathing" - the process used to adjust
        your formation after a call when needed.&nbsp; They similarly do not specify how
        designating dancers affects what to do in a call.</p>
    <p>
        As a result, I have had to use my own understanding of what it means to square dance
        to complete the definitions and algorithms the program uses.&nbsp; Any mistakes
        are therefore mine.&nbsp; There are, of course, numerous areas of disagreement over
        details of square dance choreography.&nbsp; I hope to identify those points of disagreement
        and offer you ways to tell the program how you would like those issues resolved.&nbsp;
        An important first step in that process is to let me know where you disagree with
        something that the program does.&nbsp; If it is a plain mistake, I will correct
        it.&nbsp; If there is no consensus, I will add a preference so that each opinion
        can find expression.</p>
