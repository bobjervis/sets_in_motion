<BODY>
<h1>Breathing</h1>
    <p>
        <em>Breathing</em> is the set of adjustments that dancers make at various points
        during and between calls.&nbsp; The precise definition of when and how to apply
        these adjustments does not exist.&nbsp; It may be that no consistent set of rules
        could be defined.&nbsp; For example, a strong measure of the correctness of the
        program is the degree of similarity between actual dancers performing a call and
        the animation produced for the same call.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, one desired rule might be that the physical distance between dancers
        exactly matches the number of grid spots, or half-spots, that separate them in their
        formation.</p>
    <p>
        Moreover, some calls alter In some cases a formation will change and
        dancers will typically not
        move at all, even though breathing rules imply that they should.&nbsp; For example, from a squared set, having the heads pass the ocean changes
        the set from a 4x4 arragnement to a 4x3, triple line/wave formation.&nbsp; The side
        dancers should move a half-position forward to keep their distance from the heads
        correct, but few dancers do.</p>
    <p>
        In other cases, dancers move to alter the physical distance between themselves and
        at least one other dancer, even though they have not changed their logical relationship
        with one another.&nbsp; For example, from parallel waves, if you have the centers
        hinge, the end dancers will move a half position to make diamonds even though they
        are still ends of lines.</p>
    <p>
        In creating <em>Sets in Motion</em> I have made every effort to compartmentalize
        the dancing rules so that the rules you have to write to define a call, while they
        may be more mathematical than the words in the Callerlab definition, still follow
        closely to the content of the original words.&nbsp; You should not have to be aware of a
        large number of additional rules and requirements when you sit down to write a new
        definition.&nbsp; The rules about how to perform calls that are general across calls
        for real dancers should be coded into the program in general and should not have
        to be incorporated explicitly into the call definitions themselves.</p>
    <p>
        This has proven to be quite difficult.&nbsp; Humans are equipped with powerful intuitions
        about geometry that they do not think about and will subconsciously accumulate rules
        of behavior on the dance floor without ever having heard a specific rule described.&nbsp;
        Often these intuitions are incomplete when viewed over all square dance levels and
        situations, but work just fine for most circumstances.&nbsp; Humans are also adept
        at adorning general intuitions with specific exceptions, again without the need
        for explicit teaching.</p>
    <p>
        I believe that the success of human intuition and the daunting nature of whatever
        explicit rules underly those intuitions have hobbled our ability to agree on a succinct
        set of rules to teach dancers.&nbsp; As a result, at almost any time and especially
        after we learn a new level, we can encounter a novel situation where our own internalized
        rules break down and direct us to the wrong spot.</p>
    <p>
        Computer programs possess no intuition (at least none that seem to help the programs
        learn to dance, anyway).&nbsp; They must be given explicit instruction for every
        twitch a simulated dancer must emit.&nbsp; Whatever rules that are derived for this
        purpose can then at least be discussed and compared to our own experience to decide
        whether those rules correspond to actual square dancing.</p>
    <h2>
        Callerlab Rules</h2>
    <p>
        The Callerlab Basic and Mainstream Definitions call out several rules related to
        breathing: the Same Position Rule, the Facing Couples Rule, the Ocean Wave Rule,
        the Squared Set Convention and the Circle Rule.&nbsp; <em>Sets in Motion</em> treats
        each of these rules somewhat differently.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        The Same Position Rule is applied automatically.&nbsp; The definition of the rule
        begins "If two dancers are required to occupy the same position at the end of a
        call, ...".&nbsp; The difficulty arises when you consider that many calls are written
        in terms of other calls.&nbsp; Also, some calls such as Percolate when called from an Eight
        Chain Thru formation, seem to be defined in a way that could not work unless this rule
        is applied at points during the course of the Percolate itself.&nbsp; Of course,
        to complicate matters, other calls such as Plenty 
        are danced without the Same Position Rule being applied in the middle of the second
        part (which are 2 split circulates). &nbsp; I have decided in <em>Sets in Motion</em> that the Same Position
        Rule is applied after each Part of each call, but not between actions within a single
        part of a call.</p>
    <p>
        The Facing Couples and Ocean Wave Rules are not applied automatically.&nbsp; These
        rules are instead coded into the appropriate call definitions.&nbsp; I believe that
        this is consistent with the trend to add language to Callerlab definitions to clarify
        that a particular call uses these rules.</p>
    <p>
        The Squared Set Convention and the related Circle Rule are also not applied automatically.&nbsp;
        Instead, a rather complex conditional test is written into the ANYONE ANYTHING (directional)
        call.&nbsp; These rules can only apply in situations where the caller is designating
        some dancers to do a call, so it seems only natural that the program not clutter
        general processing with tests that could only apply to a single definition anyway.&nbsp;
        The "ANYONE ANYTHING" call is itself not a Callerlab call according to their nomenclature,
        but rather a convenient way to build dancer designations into the general <em>Sets in
            Motion</em> framework.</p>
    <h2>
    </h2>
    <h2>
        Non-Callerlab Rules</h2>
    <p>
        You should understand that any rules described here are completely unofficial and
        represent my best understanding of how dancers should adjust their positions.</p>
    <h3>
        General Principles</h3>
    <p>
        These are not considered the 'rules' of breathing, but rather the principles that
        motivate the rules I have formulated.&nbsp; The rules are an attempt to generalize
        the habit of describing the 'final formation' of a call as if it were a part of
        the definition, even when the call does not explicitly say so.&nbsp; Either the
        general rules exist, or some definitions need to be amended to allow for general
        rules.&nbsp; The alternative is an exhaustive enumeration of starting and finishing
        formations for all calls.&nbsp; Clearly, dancers do not need this enumeration to
        agree on what the final formations are, even in situations where they have never
        seen the call before.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        To be sure, there are calls whose definitions specify no specific ending formation,
        relying on 'blending' with the next call to determine what to do.&nbsp; For now,
        <em>Sets in Motion</em> makes no attempt to figure out that blending process.&nbsp;
        The <a href="caller_guide.html">Caller's Guide</a> describes those calls, how the
        program handles them, and what you can say to achieve the understood formation that
        real dancers would use.</p>
    <p>
        For the overwhelming majority of calls, it is understood that the final formation
        of the call does not depend on the next words out of the caller's mouth.</p>
    <p>
        Another consideration of these principles and rules is that they should apply wherever
        possible to asymmetric situations.&nbsp; Many situations can arise in asymmetric
        calling that would never appear in symmetric calling.&nbsp; While Callerlab does
        not explicitly say so, we assume that callers will generally designate dancers in
        symmetric groups and all call definitions are written to produce symmetric outcomes
        from symmetric starting formations.&nbsp; However, asymmetric calling is popular
        and a number of callers enjoy creating asymmetric choreography.</p>
    <h4>
        Boxes are Square</h4>
    <p>
        This may seem obvious, but most of the geometry <em>Sets in Motion</em> uses to
        arrange dancers relies on this fact.&nbsp; The distance between dancers in a couple
        or mini-wave is the same as that between parallel lines or waves.&nbsp; If a call,
        considered by itself, would push dancers out of this arrangement, breathing rules
        tell them how to adjust to restore these distances or tell them exceptions where
        they must violate this rule.</p>
    <p>
        One corollary of this statement is that if you direct a subset of dancers to do
        a call that does not change their shape (between starting and ending formations),
        then the uninvolved never need to adjust their position.&nbsp; Conversely, if a
        subset call does change shape, then the uninvolved dancers will typically have to
        adjust in some manner.</p>
    <p>
        Depending on the call and initial dancer arrangement sometimes the uninvolved dancers
        remain stationary and the involved dancers must adjust.</p>
    <h4>
        Compaction</h4>
    <p>
        In general, breathing finds a compact arrangement of dancers that best maintains
        side-to-side and front-to-back distances that will make boxes square.&nbsp; There
        is no limit on the amount of lateral or longitudinal (front-to-back) motion a dancer
        must perform in order to satisfy these rules.&nbsp; For example, starting in a tidal
        wave, having the center 6 counter-rotate means that the very end dancers must end
        with only 1 dancer-distance between their inside hands.&nbsp; Before the call there
        were six dancers between them!&nbsp; They actually have to move further than most
        of the dancers involved in the call!&nbsp; And if the caller were to have the center
        6 do another counter-rotate those ininvolved dancers would have to spread apart
        again just as far!</p>
    <h4>
        Personal Space</h4>
    <p>
        Every dancer has a 'personal space' that extends around them. &nbsp;The rules of
        breathing restore this space whenever a call would otherwise place them too close
        to another dancer.</p>
    <p>
        <img align=left src="personal_space.png" />
        The way to think of this space is as a diamond inscribed within a square.&nbsp;
        The diamond can never overlap with the diamond-shaped central zone of any other
        dancer's personal space.&nbsp; The points of this diamond at each side of the dancer
        represents the center of each hand.&nbsp; Thus, adjacent dancers have their diamonds
        just touching at the points.&nbsp; The diamond extends the same distance in front
        of their nose and behind them as well.&nbsp; Parallel lines or waves have personal-space
        diamonds touching just at the front and back points.</p>
    <p>
        The large square around a dancer is a little more permissive.&nbsp; The only way
        the square around a given dancer can overlap with the personal diamond of another
        dancer is when they are standing at right angles, such as the centers of a star
        or thar.&nbsp; Thus, we can have up to four dancers touching hands at the same spot.</p>
    <p>
        In general, if a call does not place dancers touching hands at right angles, the
        rules of breathing will not do so.&nbsp; If dancers are too far apart, they will
        move together until their personal-space squares are touching, but no closer.</p>
    <h4>
        Inside and Outside</h4>
    <p>
        The most complicated situations arise when one group of dancers is 'inside' and
        doing something different from whatever dancers are 'outside'.&nbsp; In general,
        the 'inside' dancers will hold their final positions and the 'outside' dancers will
        close in or spread apart, as needed.</p>
    <p>
        &lt;&lt; This section is under construction and is incomplete. &gt;&gt;</p>
    <h3>
        Rules</h3>
    <h4>
        Handhold Rule</h4>
    <p>
        The first rule of breathing that is not described by Callerlab, but is implemented
        by <em>Sets in Motion</em> can be called the Handhold Rule or less generally the
        Diamond Point Rule (the most common situation where it applies).&nbsp; This rule
        can, under the right circumstances, apply to all the dancers on the floor.&nbsp;
        Essentially, any dancer who finds themselves standing with a shoulder toward a dancer
        who has an appropriate hand-hold should step slightly forward or back to put their
        body in line with the hand-hold.</p>
    <p>
        To find these "appropriate handholds" the only dancers that matter are dancers with one hand just touching a center line
        and the hand-hold that matters is any they have with their <strong>other</strong>
        hand.&nbsp; For example, at home positions, all dancers have one hand touching a
        center line (sides are touching the side-to-side center line and the heads are touching
        the front-to-back center line).&nbsp; However, none of these dancers has anyone
        by their other hand, so no one adjusts.&nbsp; Suppose now, though, that we have
        the sides face and the heads pass the ocean.&nbsp; Now the heads are all standing
        on the front-to-back center line, but the head girls are just touching the side-to-side
        center line.&nbsp; Also, the head girls have a head boy in their other hand.&nbsp;
        So now the sides must step back to make diamond points by aligning themeselves exactly
        between the head boys and girls.</p>
    <p>
        It doesn't matter whether the hand hold is in a couple or a mini-wave, nor does
        it matter that the hand-hold dancers are standing on the other center line.&nbsp;
        Suppose we have facing boy-boy-girl-girl lines and have the boys bend the line.&nbsp;
        We now have the right-hand dancer in each couple touching a center line.&nbsp; So
        each girl couple has to back up to align themselves with the boys and the boys
        have to back up slightly to align themselves with the girls.&nbsp; This creates
        one variation of the phantom formation (as illustrated in the Callerlab Approved
        Formations document - no. 62 in the August, 2009 version)..</p>
    <p>
        When dancers make this adjustment, it does not alter the fact that they are part
        of a line formation, nor does it alter whether they are a center or an end of that
        line.&nbsp; This is why we say that diamond points are ends of lines, even though
        the points on the same end of the line are clearly standing too far apart from one
        another for lines.</p>
    <p>
        Note that dancers who had to make this adjustment will undo this adjustment if some
        following call eliminates the hand-hold they were centered on.&nbsp; For example,
        calling "Centers Hinge" from twin diamonds should see the end dancers move closer
        together to make the parallel lines or waves that are the proper final formation
        after this call.</p>
