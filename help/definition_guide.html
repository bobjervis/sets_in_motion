<TITLE>Sets in Motion: Call Writer's Guide</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<h1>Call Writer's Guide</h1>
<p>Writing definitions for <i>Sets in Motion</i> requires a much deeper
understanding of the inner workings of the program.
While many calls can be expressed fairly directly, fine tuning the definition
can improve the appearance of the animation that comes out.
That often requires an appreciation of what the primitives do, how the basic algorithm works. In short, how the pieces fit together.
</p>
<p>
It became fairly obvious as I was writing the first definitions for the Basic calls
that phrasing the actions precisely is very important to get the timing right and the
movements of the dancers anything approaching what actual dancers do.
This program is a long way from Hollywood quality animation, or does it currently implement anything like natural kinetics.
Smoothing the various motions described in the definitions is an important long-term
project that looks challenging as I write this.
For now, accept my apologies for the silly ways that the cyber dancers gambol about.
It is a work in progress and there is so much else to be done.
</p>
<p>
At present the most basic functions to create new calls, define starting formations and
multi-part action sequences is working.
Navigating through the various windows and entering the necessary data is still very stiff.
Convenience functions will be added as time permits, but are currently very rudimentary.
Please give me feedback on missing or awkward operations that you want to perform and 
that are missing from the interface.
</p>
    <p>
        The largest missing piece is the fact that there currently is no facility for either
        viewing or modifying formations.&nbsp; This is the top priority item for the user
        interface and will be added as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
The definitions included in the default set include the Callerlab Basic list, as well as a number of
useful calls from other lists (such as "Roll").
A definition does not have to be written in terms of other calls from the same list.  
The definitions also frequently refer to <i>primitives</i> (built-in functions that manipulate the
dancers and do most of the real work of the program).
I am certain that many of the calls have bugs, are missing starting formations and could generally 
be improved.
I am working to put together a database of sequences that can serve as a test-bed.
If the program can perform all of the calls and resolve each test sequence, then we
can have some confidence that the calls and formations in the test sequences
are correct.
As more levels are added, concepts will rapidly multiply the combinations of calls and the
complexity of outcomes.
It will not be possible to exhaustively test every possible call anyone could write with
this program.
Someone has to hand check each questionable case to decide whether the program is in fact
wrong and, if so, how.
</p>
<p>
All this serves as a plea for anyone who finds the program doing the wrong thing.
Please, tell me about the mistakes it makes.
Otherwise I may never fix it, and if you find something wrong, odds are good that others
are seeing it too.
I want this program to be as good a calling and dancing assistant as possible.
</p>
    <h2>
        General Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        The definition of a call is written in terms of a choice amongst several sequences
        of actions.&nbsp; The choosing process involves matching patterns of dancers and
        applying the sequence of actions that are assigned to that pattern.&nbsp; These
        actions are written as other calls.&nbsp; These other calls, in turn, are written
        in terms of still other calls, and so on.&nbsp; This process only stops when you
        reach one of the forty or so <em>primitives</em>.&nbsp; A primitive is a function
        that carries out some very specific movement or grouping of dancers.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        Calling a primitive is done by writing a primitive in the action of a call definition
        in any place where it would be valid to write a call.&nbsp; Thus, the whole contents
        of an action may be a single primitive.&nbsp; You may also apply any of the rules
        for composing calls.&nbsp; So, for example, you could say "heads &lt;&lt;some primitive&gt;&gt;"
        if you just wanted the heads to perform its action.&nbsp; Unlike calls, which use
        a loose syntax that you can extend, primitives use a relatively rigid and unambiguous
        syntax akin to that of algebra or a programming language.</p>
    <p>
        The model implied by the operations of the primitives is a highly abstracted and
        simplified view of the dance floor.&nbsp; For example, the primitives do not have
        a way to describing the absolute location of a dancer.&nbsp; Indeed, about the only absolute
        location that can be described in a primitive is the center of the set (<span style="font-family: monospace">$center</span>).&nbsp; Dancer motions are
        described in terms of each dancer's current location and facing direction.</p>
    <p>
        The primitives are implemented by the C++ code of the program.&nbsp; At this level,
        the exact position and orientation of dancers is maintained and manipulated.&nbsp;
        Some of the work that is done at this level, while theoretically of no interest
        to anyone writing primitives, actually helps explain how things happen.</p>
    <p>
        In particular, the Dancers class is a crucial data structure used extensively in
        the dance resolution code.&nbsp; An instance of the Dancers class includes a set
        of 0 or more dancers in a specific configuration on the floor.&nbsp; The class implements
        a set of operations that correspond closely to many of the primitives.&nbsp; One
        of the essential abstractions represented in the Dancers class is the notion of
        a 2 dimensional space in which the dancers are located.&nbsp; Look at the essay
        on <a href=geometry.html>Geometries, Rotations and Coordinate Systems</a> for
        a more complete explanation of how dancers are arranged by the program.</p>
    <h2>
        The C++ Code</h2>
    <p>
        The C++ code of the program currently contains 95 classes specific to the dancing
        code.&nbsp; There are many more classes involved in infrastructure code like the
        display widgets, collection classes, etc.&nbsp; Of the dance 95 classes, they break down
        more or less as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unit tests.&nbsp; 4 classes.&nbsp; Unit tests are instances of unit test classes.</li>
        <li>UI edit commands.&nbsp; 22 classes.&nbsp; Each individual edit is an instance of
            a class that has an undo and redo operation.</li>
        <li>UI display classes.&nbsp; 14 classes.&nbsp; These implement the various specific
            sub-windows of the UI.</li>
        <li>File data structures.&nbsp; 9 classes.&nbsp; The various definitions, sequences
            and other data stored in files.&nbsp; These are generally the objects modified by
            the UI edit commands above.</li>
        <li>Parsing classes.&nbsp; 22 classes.&nbsp; These classes define support information
            for the parsers or else the information parsed.&nbsp; This includes formation parsing
            as well as the syntax of calls and primitives.</li>
        <li>Dance execution classes.&nbsp; 24 classes.&nbsp; These classes describe the data
            constructed to describe what calls are being performed, the dancers in them and
            the dancer motions generated by them.&nbsp; This data is the basis for what appears
            in the Call Analysis and Animator views.</li></ul>
    <p>
        The count of classes is somewhat misleading.&nbsp; Just one dance execution class
        (Dancers), which is responsible for implementing most of the primitive dancer motions,
        contains 18% of all the application-specific C++ code!&nbsp; For comparison, all
        36 UI classes together contain just 20% of this C++ code.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        Various Topics</h2>
    <p>
        The following topics address various issues with no particular structure yet.&nbsp;
        This section is very early in construction and is far from complete enough.&nbsp;
        I do not expect anyone to go to the trouble of trying to write complex call definitions
        yet.&nbsp; Eventually I want to produce a fairly robust set of documents describing
        the program's internals that should allow anyone with the desire and patience to
        learn it.</p>
