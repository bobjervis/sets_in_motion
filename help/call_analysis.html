<h1>Call Analysis Browser</h1>
    <p>
        The sub-window that you can use to drill into the details of a call is called the
        Call Analysis Browser.&nbsp; It will appear in the right-hand pane of the main window
        whenever you click on a drill-down button in a Sequence Editor.</p>
    <p><img align=right src=call_analysis_sample.png />The image at right shows a sample
        sequence in which the drilldown button of the second call, "circle to a line", has
        been clicked.</p>
    <p>
        In the right-hand pane, you see Back and Forward &nbsp;buttons at the top of the
        window.&nbsp; When you have drilled into several pages, you can use these buttons
        to navigate back and forward through the pages.&nbsp; (Note that these buttons do
        not currently change to indicate whether there are more pages available if you were
        to click on them.)</p>
    <p>
        In the page view itself, you see the structured break down of the call itself at
        the top of the page.&nbsp; Immediately below that is a diagram of the dancer's starting
        formation.&nbsp; Depending on what was needed to perform the call, what appears
        below varies.</p>
    <p>
        In this case, the call had to be performed by breaking the square down into pieces
        and performing the call in each piece.&nbsp; You see to facing couples drawn from
        the starting formation, then under each group the call as applied to that group.&nbsp;
        Note that unless the call is a primitive, when the call is broken down into subgroups
        like this, you will be offered a drilldown button to look in detail at each group's
        call.</p>
    <p>
        When a call is broken down into sub-groups like this, the final dancer positions
        may not be exactly right.&nbsp; In such a case, the program must 'breathe' the formation
        to arrive at the final dancer configuration.&nbsp; If that was needed, then a 'Before
        Breathing' box as drawn (as in this case) with the un-adjusted positions of the
        dancers.</p>
    <p>
        In this case, the adjustment was to slide the two lines closer together.</p>
    <p><img align=left src=call_analysis_sample2.png />A multi-step call will show a series
        of sub-calls and diagrams as in the example on the left.&nbsp; In this case we see
        a part of the drill-down for "shoot the star to another thar".</p>
    <p>
        There are technical reasons why the individual primitive calls appear twice each,
        but in future releases the analysis pages will get cleaned up so the output is hopefully
        a little less cluttered and easier to comprehend.</p>
