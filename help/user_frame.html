<h1>The Window Frame</h1>
    <p>
        When you launch the <em>Sets in Motion</em> shortcut, the program brings up an initial
        window like the one pictured here.<img align=right src=start_screen.png />&nbsp;
        For now concentrate on the top row of rectangular labels.&nbsp; Each of these is
        a tab that is attached to a specific sub-window.&nbsp; As you use the program more
        such tabs will appear for the additional sub-windows that are needed.&nbsp; At any
        time you can select a tab
        by clicking on it.&nbsp; When you select any tab, it will
        bring its given sub-window forward and give it control of the keyboard.&nbsp; You
        will see a blinking cursor in any text field where you can type in that window,
        if any.</p>
    <p>
        The two halves of the main window are divided by a thin vertical strip.&nbsp; If
        you move the mouse cursor over that strip, the mouse cursor changes to a left-right
        double arrow.&nbsp; That signals that you are over the strip and if you press the
        left mouse button, you can drag the separator bar to the left or right.&nbsp; This
        allows you to arrange the window as you wish to give you however much space you
        like in each portion of the window.</p>
    <p>
        The small square button in the far right portion of the tab area is the "More" button.&nbsp;
        <img align=left src=more_menu.png />
        This button gives you access to a veriety of additional functions.&nbsp; If you
        click on it, the menu shown at the left will appear under the mouse cursor.&nbsp;
        Note that this button responds to the left mouse button.&nbsp; This is not a context
        menu (which is attached to the right mouse button).&nbsp; Like all the pop-up menus
        in <em>Sets in Motion</em>, as you move the mouse cursor over the menu choises,
        one will highlight.&nbsp; If you click on the highlighted item, you have selected
        that one.&nbsp; If you click outside the menu (so that no items are highlighted),
        then the menu is closed and no action is taken.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Open file...</b>:</td>
            <td>
                Pops up a Windows file open dialog.&nbsp; You may select a single file. &nbsp; If
                the file has the extension .CDF it is opened as a definitions file.&nbsp; If the
                file has the extension .DNC it is opened as a dance file.&nbsp; If the file has
                any other extension, or none at all, it is treated as an SD output file and is loaded
                as a dance file.&nbsp; Note that when parsed and loaded as an SD output file, you
                cannot save any changes back to the original file.&nbsp; Instead, you will be offered
                to create a new dance file with the same name as the original file, but with a .DNC
                extension.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>New Dance</b>:</td>
            <td>
                This creates a new dance sub-window in the right-hand half of the main window.&nbsp;
                The window has no associated file until you save it the first time, when a Windows
                save file dialog is opened and you are given the opportunity to select a filename
                and save the file anywhere on your disk.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Open Definitions Tab</b>:</td>
            <td>
                The Definitions tab is selected and brought to the front.&nbsp; If it has been closed
                it will be re-opened in the left-hand half of the main window.&nbsp; If that tab
                is already selected, this function has no further effect.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Open My Definitions Tab</b>:</td>
            <td>
                The My Definitions tab is selected.&nbsp; If it has been closed it will be re-opened
                in the left-hand half of the main window.&nbsp; If that tab is already selected,
                the function has no further effect.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Open My Library Tab</b>:</td>
            <td>
                The My Library tab is selected.&nbsp; If it has been closed it will be re-opened
                in the right-hand half of the main window.&nbsp; If that tab is already selected,
                the function has no further effect.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Open Preferences Tab</b>:</td>
            <td>
                The Preferences tab is selected.&nbsp; If it has been closed it will be re-opened
                in the right-hand half of the main window.&nbsp; If that tab is already selected,
                the function has no further effect.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        If you right-click on any tab, you will be shown a context menu specific to that
        window.&nbsp; Any tab will include the "Close" option in
        its context menu.&nbsp; Selecting that option will remove the tab from those showing
        at the top of the window.</p>
    <p>
        If you right-click on either the Definitions or My Definitions tabs, you will see
        a context menu under the mouse cursor that has just two or three choices on it.<img align=left src=definition_menu.png />&nbsp; The menu has only two options on it when the corresponding file has no unsaved edits.&nbsp;
        Definitions files can be either locked or unlocked.&nbsp; A locked definitions file
        is read-only and cannot be modified while it is locked.&nbsp; If the file is currently
        unlocked (and can be edited), then the menu at left will be shown.&nbsp; If you
        selected the "Lock to prevent editing", any further editing of the file will be
        disallowed until you unlock the file again.</p>
    <p>
        If the file is currently locked you will see the menu at right.<img align=right src=definition_menu_unlock.png />&nbsp;
        When you select "Unlock for editing", you may then make modifications to the file.&nbsp;
        Noe that the default Definitions file is locked initially.&nbsp; This precaution
        is in place to make you think before you edit the default Definitions (though you
        can obviously unlock it yourself and make whatever edits you like).</p>
    <p>
        When the tab you have right-clicked on is a definitions file with unsaved edits
        you will see the menu on the left.<img align=left src=definition_menu_save.png />&nbsp;
        Select the Save Definitions item to save any edits to the disk.&nbsp; Note that
        if you have unsaved edits, you can still Lock the file against further changes and
        you can still Save the file while it is locked.&nbsp; Note that while the file is
        locked you won't be able to Undo or Redo edits either.</p>
    <p>
        When you right-click on a tab for a definition editor, it will aso offer the Lock/Unlock
        menu items.&nbsp; If you select these options from a definition editor tab, you
        will lock or unlock the entire definitions file, not just the specific definition
        in the current sub-window.</p>
