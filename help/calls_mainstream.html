<TITLE>Sets in Motion: Basic Calls</TITLE>

<BODY>
<h1>Callerlab Basic Level Calls</h1>
    <p>
        These calls are organized by the Callerlab call names and numbering, using the Callerlab
        Basic and Mainstream Definitions document dated November 1, 2009.</p>
    <p>
        Sections are included below for each call, even if there is nothing said in that
        section.&nbsp; If nothing is said, then the call should work as you would expect.</p>
        <h3>52. Cloverleaf</h3>
    <h4>
        52.a Cloverleaf (Everyone Active)</h4>
    <h4>
        52.b Cloverleaf (2 Couples Only Active)</h4>
    <p>
        This variation is implemented as well as I can understand both the definition as
        written and the way callers and dancers expet this to be done.&nbsp; For example,
        the definition states that the inactive dancers move forward into the middle if
        they are facing that way.&nbsp; However, my experience is that the inactive dancers
        are expected to move together to the middle spots no matter how the are facing.&nbsp;
        The program moves inactives together regardless of facing.</p>
    <h3>
        53. Turn Thru</h3>
    <h3>
        54. Eight Chain Thru / Eight Chain 1, 2, 3, etc.</h3>
    <h3>
        55. Pass to the Center</h3>
    <h3>
        56. Single Hinge/ Couples Hinge</h3>
    <h3>
        57. Centers In</h3>
    <h3>
        58. Cast Off 3/4</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Sets in Motion</em> allows any quarter fraction, not just 3/4.</p>
    <h3>
        59. Spin the Top</h3>
    <h3>
        60. Walk and Dodge</h3>
    <h3>
        61. Slide Thru</h3>
    <h3>
        62. Fold / Cross Fold</h3>
    <p>
        This call explicitly states that dancers should not adjust after folding.&nbsp;
        As in many cases in square dancing, there are adjustments and there are adjustments.&nbsp;
        It seems to be common to assume that dancers will adjust to boxes after a fold or
        cross fold call.&nbsp; The SD program, for example, will adjust to boxes (and thereby
        make a column)after the call "ends fold" from parallel ocean waves.&nbsp; If one
        had called "ends press ahead" from parallel ocean waves, the in-facing end dancers
        step forward to the next wave.&nbsp; However, in a fold the folding dancers do not
        interact with the other wave.&nbsp; Instead, the ends fold to face the back of the
        center wave dancers and the two waves spread apart to make a Z formation.&nbsp;
        This is what <em>Sets in Motion</em> does.</p>
    <p>
        Similarly, the call "centers cross fold" from out-facing lines, which is explicitly
        allowed in the definition, should produce two single-file columns with two phantom
        spots between each column.&nbsp; <em>Sets in Motion</em> does this.</p>
    <p>
        Sadly, Mainstream calls do not give you much ability to work with either Z's or
        single-file columns with phantoms.&nbsp; This is likely the reason that Mainstream
        dancers do adjust to boxes after folds and cross folds.</p>
    <p>
        To give you the option of adjusting, <em>Sets in Motion</em> includes the directional
        call "adjust to a box" (see under <a href="calls_general.html#adjust_to_a_box">Directional
            Calls</a>).</p>
    <h3>
        63. Dixie Style to an Ocean Wave</h3>
    <p>
        The definition as written allows this call from facing Tandems.&nbsp; This would
        suggest that the call "dixie style to a wave" from a beginning double pass thru
        would have the dancers work single-file (since those are facing tandems).&nbsp;
        This is not generally done.&nbsp; Instead, a caller is expected to say something
        like "working single-file, dixie style to a wave".&nbsp; At present, <em>Sets in Motion</em>
        does not support any phrasing like "single-file", but it does allow you to call
        "dixie style to a wave" from a beginning double pass thru formation.</p>
    <h3>
        64. Spin Chain Thru</h3>
    <h3>
        65. Tag the Line (In/Out/Left/Right)</h3>
    <p>
        At present the In/Out/Left/Right variations of this call are not allowed.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>
        66. Half Tag</h3>
    <h3>
        67. Scoot back</h3>
    <h3>
        68. Recycle (from a wave only)</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
