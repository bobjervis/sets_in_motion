<h1>Callerlab Plus Level Calls</h1>
    <p>
        These calls are organized by the Callerlab call names in the table of contents of
        the Callerlab Plus Definitions document dated December 10, 2007.</p>
    <p>
        Sections are included below for each call, even if there is nothing said in that
        section.&nbsp; If nothing is said, then the call should work as you would expect.</p>
        <h3>
            1. Acey Deucey</h3>
    <h3>
        2. All 8 Spin the Top</h3>
    <h3>
        3. (Anything) and Roll</h3>
    <p>
        The call "roll" is defined as a standa-lone call, so it can be written on a line
        by itself, or added as an "and roll" suffix to most any other call.</p>
    <h3>
        4. (Anything) and Spread</h3>
    <p>
        The call is not yet fully implemented.&nbsp;
        It will work for many preceding calls,
        but not all.&nbsp; This is a known bug.</p>
    <h3>
        5. Chase Right</h3>
    <h3>
        6. Coordinate</h3>
    <p>
        This call is restricted to columns at the Plus level.&nbsp; Other starting formations
        are used, particularly at higher levels, but
        they stretch the definition a bit and
        are always considered to be hard variations.</p>
    <h3>
        7. Crossfire</h3>
    <h3>
        8. Cut the Diamond</h3>
    <h3>
        9. Diamond Circulate</h3>
    <h3>
        10. Dixie Grand</h3>
    <h3>
        11. Explode and (Anything)</h3>
    <p>
        The call "Explode" can be written by itself and means "Explode and do nothing".</p>

    <h3>
        13. Fan the Top</h3>
    <h3>

        17. Linear Cycle</h3>
    <h3>
        18. Load the Boat</h3>
    <p>
        The definitions work in a variety of starting formations besides facing lines.&nbsp;
        Definitions are also included for "do the centers/ends part of load the boat" as
        four-dancer calls.</p>
    <h3>

        24. Spin Chain and Exchange the Gears</h3>

        A variant definition is included to "turn the stars" by a given fraction.</p>
    <h3>
        25. Spin Chain the Gears</h3>
    <p>
        A variant definition is include to "turn the stars" by a given fraction.</p>

    <h3>
        27. 3/4 Tag the Line</h3>
    <p>

        29. Trade the Wave</h3>
