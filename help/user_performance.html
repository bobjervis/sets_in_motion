<TITLE>Sets in Motion: Performance Window</TITLE>

<BODY>
<h1>Performance Window</h1>
<p>The separate window that you use to read a sequence, typically performing the sequence during a dance, is called
the Performance Window.</p>

   <p>
        <img align=right src=performance_window.png />At right you can see an image of
       a Performance Window loaded with a Basic level sequence.&nbsp; As you click the
       space bar, the reverse-video bar advances to the next call.&nbsp; As the bar gets
       to the bottom of the screen, the window will scroll to keep the highlighted bar
       in view at all times.<p>
           When you are done with a sequence, you can press the Enter key to advance to the
           next sequence (if you are performing more than one sequence at a time).&nbsp; The
           following is a complete list of the keystrokes and what they do in the Performance
           Window:</p>
   <ul>
        <li><strong>Enter</strong> - Advances to the next sequence being performed.</li>
       <li><strong>+</strong> - Same as Enter.</li>
       <li><strong>-</strong> - Backs up one sequence.</li>
       <li><strong>Space Bar</strong> - Advances one call.</li>
       <li><strong>Up Arrow</strong> - Backs up one sequence.</li>
       <li><strong>Down Arrow</strong> - Advances one sequence.</li>
       <li><strong>Left Arrow</strong> - Backs up one sequence.</li>
       <li><strong>Right Arrow</strong> - Advances one sequence.</li>
   </ul>
       <p>
           In the future, this window will be expanded in both capability and flexibility.</p>
