<h1>Sequence Editor</h1>
    <p>
        The sub-window that you can use to view or edit a whole sequence is called a Sequence
        Editor.&nbsp; It appears in the left-hand pane of the main window.</p>
    <p><img align=right src=sequence_editor_sample.png />
        The image on the right shows a sample Sequence Editor containing an new, barely
        begun sequence.&nbsp; The top field is a one-line comment field.&nbsp; You can right anything
        you like in there.&nbsp; It will show in the Dance Editor and may help you identify
        it in a long list of sequences, or you may use it to contain information on difficulty.</p>
    <p>
        The Created field gives the date when the sequence was created.</p>
    <p>
        The Modified field contains the date of the last modification.</p>
    <p>
        The Created With field identifies the program and version used to create the sequence.&nbsp;
        Note that for any sequence created with this program, you will see "SiMv1.0alpha3"
        in that field.&nbsp; Future releases of the program will update that value.&nbsp;
        That way, if there is any question about the compatibility of an older file with
        a future version, this information might help.</p>
    <p>
        The Level field is the level of the Sequence.&nbsp; All calls in the sequence must
        have a level less than or equal to this value.&nbsp; If you select a blank value,
        any calls at all can be used in the sequence regardless of level.</p>
    <p>
        The rest of the window is taken up by the Call Area.&nbsp; Each call takes one line
        of the display.&nbsp; Currently, long lines will not wrap around, so you must resize
        the window if the space is not wide enough for your call.</p>
    <p>
        The Call Area itself is white and is large enough to hold the existing calls and
        the current call being typed
        (as in the example).&nbsp; The rest of the area is
        available to hold suggested completions for the current call.&nbsp; Since the user
        has typed "heads s" the program has found quite a few possible calls that start
        with S.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        You can click on any of the calls in the call area that have their text in black.&nbsp;
        If this were a resolved sequence there would also appear a grey 'home' after the
        last call.&nbsp; You cannot select the 'home' lines.&nbsp; They are there to indicate
        the start and end of the sequence.&nbsp; Once the sequence resolves and the trailing
        'home' string appears, you must change some existing call in the sequence to alter
        the position.&nbsp; The program will automatically add or remove the 'home' string
        as appropriate.</p>
    <p>
        When no traiiling 'home' string, you can click on the blank line immediately below
        the last call in order to lengthen the sequence.</p>
    <p><img align=left src=sequence_editor_error1.png />Note that if you type a call that
        does not work, the word 'Failed' in red will appear to the left of the call.&nbsp;
        In addition, an explanation will be written in red characters below the call itself.&nbsp;
        In some cases, a call will be legal, but the program will insert a comment string
        in orange.&nbsp; This is a flow warning and you can ignore it if you like.&nbsp;
        At this point, the warnings are experimental as I am trying to figure out exactly
        what conditions are worth tagging.</p>
    <p>
        Note that if the call failed and the error text below the call is written inside
        a solid yellow background, this indicates a program bug, rather than a user error.&nbsp;
        In general, if the error text is on a white background, the reason the call did
        not work is that, according to the definitions in the program, this call is not
        allowed from the current position.</p>
    <p>
        Please report all program bugs to me.&nbsp; Also report any instance in which you
        disagree with the program's decision to mark a call as failed.</p>
    <p>
        Unless the call has failed because of some grammatical mistake (like a typo), you
        will notice that a small button with a question mark appears on the line to the
        far left of the call.&nbsp; This is a<em> drilldown</em> button.&nbsp; Whenever
        you see a button like this, clicking on it will open up a Call Analysis page in
        the right-hand side of the main window.&nbsp; This view will give you a step-by-step
        guide through the call.&nbsp; Depending on what is happening in the call, there
        may be further drilldown buttons in the analysis page as well.&nbsp; See the documentation
        of the <a href="call_analysis.html">Call Analysis Browser</a> for more details.</p>
    <p>
        Note that you can cut-copy-paste text from a single line to or from these text fields
        to other fields in this program or in any other Windows application.&nbsp; Pasting
        large multi-line blocks of text from another program may not produce very good results
        in <em>Sets in Motion</em>.</p>
    <p>
        In addition to positioning the text cursor in a particular call, when you click
        on a call in the call area (including either 'home' string) you will open an Animation
        screen in the right-hand side of the main window.&nbsp; The blue triangle that appears
        to the left of a call in the Sequence Editor indicates where the Animation screen
        is currently showing.&nbsp; See the documentation of <a href="animator.html">Animation</a>
        for more details.</p>
    <p>
        If you press the Insert key when the cursor is in any call text, you will immediately
        insert a new, blank call into the sequence at the line where the cursor is currently
        located.</p>
    <p>
        If you right-click over a call, you will be given a menu with two choices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insert a call</strong>&nbsp; Shifts all calls from the one under the mouse
            cursor to the bottom of the sequence down one and inserts a new blank call into
            the current line.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete this call</strong>&nbsp; Shift all calls below this line up by one
            and erases the current call.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
