<h1>Release Notes</h1>
    <p>
        Note: prior release notes are appended in reverse order below these notes.</p>
    <p>
        The is the fourth Alpha<strong><em> </em></strong>release of <em>Sets in Motion.</em></p>
    <h3>
        Features Planned</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>More calls.&nbsp; Advanced-2 is up next. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Features Added</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The A-1 list has been added to the definitions.</li>
        <li>Call definitions can use two forms of action now: the original single expression
            for simple actions, or a new multi-track action for definitions where groups of
            two or four dancers at a time are performing distinct moves. </li>
        <li>You can drag tabs from one side of the window to the other to customize the layout
            as you like.</li>
        <li>The program will now do calculations of the call results without locking up the
            user interface.&nbsp; This makes startup much faster.</li>
        <li>Dance files (such as your Library) will store the last checked status.&nbsp; That
            way, if you don't modify the definitions between runs of the program, it doesn't
            have to recheck every call every time the program starts.</li></ol>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        In the following lists, the letters <strong><em>SD1</em></strong>, <strong><em>SD2</em></strong>,
        <strong><em>SD3</em> </strong>denote bugs in square dance choreography while <strong><em>UI1</em></strong>,
        <strong><em>UI2</em></strong>, <strong><em>UI3</em></strong> denote user interface
        bugs.&nbsp; The number indicates the severity of the bug.&nbsp; Likelihood of encountering
        the bug is not considered in severity. &nbsp;Severity describes how badly the user
        is impacted when the bug does occur.&nbsp; The impact criteria for severity settings
        are intended to be objective, but borderline cases will always present themselves.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        Severity should be interpreted according to the following scale:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Severity 1 bugs are catastrophic.&nbsp; The user can lose data entirely including
            unsaved edits and/or file contents.&nbsp; Data may not be obliterated completely
            but may be inaccessible to the user.&nbsp; So, a bug that leaves on-disk data intact,
            but causes the program to crash on startup every time would have severity 1.</li>
        <li>Severity 2 bugs are blocking functionality.&nbsp; Data that you have entered is
            still present and accessible, but some discrete function does not work correctly
            and no work around is possible to achieve the desired function.&nbsp; A display
            field that shows incorrect data, for example, would be blocking if the information
            was not available anywhere else in the program.</li>
        <li>Severity 3 bugs are non-blocking.&nbsp; Data you have entered is present and accessible.&nbsp;
            Some discrete function does not work or some display is misleading, confusing or
            malformed.&nbsp; However, any obscured information is available by some other means
            and actions you want taken can be done somehow using the program.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Known Bugs</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><em>SD2 </em></strong>Four-dancer stars are not supported in most circumstances..
        </li>
        <li><strong><em>SD2 </em></strong>Couples are not defined for infacing rings, where
            boy-girl arrangements should be able to do couple-based calls. </li>
        <li><strong><em>SD2 </em></strong>From a squared set, the call 'turn your partner by
            the left 1/2' does not produce a thar.&nbsp; It should. </li>
        <li><strong><em>SD2 </em></strong>Dancers move through one another without collision.&nbsp;
            This is also impossible.</li>
        <li><strong><em>SD2 </em></strong>Spread does not correctly take into account how the
            previous call ended.&nbsp; It should.</li>
        <li><strong><em>SD2</em></strong> Do your part does not work correctly if a counter-part
            dancer cannot be found when the facing of a phantom is uncertain.</li>
        <li><strong><em>UI2 </em></strong>Scroll bars in the Definition Editor get misaligned.&nbsp;
            Some parts of large, long definitions are inaccessible. </li>
        <li><strong><em>UI3 </em></strong>The headings in the Dance Editor are misaligned. </li>
        <li><strong><em>UI3 </em></strong>The Formation Editor will sometimes shift the displayed
            position of a formation if new spots are added (this sometimes shifts the spots
            completely out of view).&nbsp; Saving and restarting the program fixes the problem.
        </li>
        <li><strong><em>UI3 </em></strong>Animations of a weave the ring do not show correct
            motions (but do not fail, so the problem is in the partial results).</li>
        <li><em><strong>UI3 </strong></em>The animation for six-two acy deucey does not work
            correctly for four of the dancers.&nbsp; The final position is, however, correct.</li>

    <h3>
        Bugs Fixed</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><em>SD2</em></strong> U-turn back does not properly account for dancer flow.
        </li>
        <li><strong><em>UI3</em></strong> Scroll bars in the Grammar Editor grow much faster
            than the size of the window shrinks.&nbsp; Scroll bars get created precisely when
            they are needed, but as the window shrinks further, the scroll bar overcompensates
            and a large white space develops as you scroll to the bottom. </li>
        <li><strong><em>UI2 </em></strong>The text displayed for an ampersand is not correct
            (essentially the ampersands disappear). </li>
        <li><strong><em>UI3 </em></strong>The tab heading for a new sequence does not update
            when you change the comment. </li>

        Alpha-3 Release Notes- July 3, 2010</h2>
    <p>
        The is the third Alpha<strong><em> </em></strong>release of <em>Sets in Motion.</em></p>
    <h3>
        Features Planned</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>More calls.&nbsp; Advanced is up next.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Features Added</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The Plus list has been added to the definitions.</li>
        <li>The exact version of the product is now displayed in the lower right corner of the
            main window of the program.</li>
        <li>A Dancer Designator editor has been added.&nbsp; Now when you expand the Dancer
            Designations section of a grammar and click on a dancer designator, a Designator
            editor will be brought up in the left-hand sub-window.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>A variety of dancer designations have been added that allow you to more precisely
            describe which dancers you want to perform an action.&nbsp; Combinations such as
            <strong>lead center heads</strong> can be typed.&nbsp; You can also specify two
            or more groups, as in <strong>boys and side girls</strong>.</li>
        <li>It is now possible to write formations with Inactive dancers in them (see the <em>
            center_box</em> formation and the revised definition for Box Circulate for an example
            of how this is used).</li>
        <li>A Performance Window has been added.&nbsp; When you select one or more sequences
            you can choose to Perform them, which will open a separate window where you can
            read the calls in sequence with a minimum of additional detial to get in the way.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>Preferences have been added to allow you to set the fonts used in the Performance
            Window.</li>
        <li>When you create a new Sequence, the editor now automatically puts you on the first
            line of the sequence, shows the animation and sets the level to the level of the
            last sequence you had in the Sequence Editor.&nbsp; This should allow you to quickly
            get started on a new sequence.</li>
        <li>The sequence editor has been enhanced with a new area below the calls where a list
            of possible completions of your current typing are shown.&nbsp; These lists update
            as you change the sequence level or type in more text.</li></ol>

    <h3>
        Bugs Fixed</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><em>SD2 </em></strong>Limited four-dancer stars are now supported.&nbsp;
            Dancers in twin diamonds can be switched to four-dancer
            stars which can then be turned.&nbsp; Twin four-dancer stars can subsequently be
            restored to diamonds.</li>
        <li><strong><em>SD2 </em></strong>Two-ladies chain 3/4 now works.</li>
        <li><strong><em>SD2 </em></strong>The Same Position Rule was not working correctly.&nbsp;
            Calls that made dancers collide would fail with "Motions are not valid".</li>
        <li><strong><em>SD2 </em></strong>From a quarter tag, calling "centers cast off 3/4'
            should yield a proper 2x4 arrangement.&nbsp; It does now. </li>
        <li><strong><em>UI1 </em></strong>The program could run out of fonts, but in practice
            this would require substantial amounts of usage (opening and closing lots of windows,
            printing lots of pages, etc.). </li>
        <li><strong><em>UI1 </em></strong>Under some conditions when you have opened a call
            in the Call Analysis browser, the program will crash when you modify a definition
            (which should flush the analysis pages).</li>

    <h2>
        Alpha-2 Release Notes- June 3, 2010</h2>
    <p>
        This is the second Alpha release of <em>Sets in Motion</em>.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>Features Planned</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Some form of 'smart' editing of sequences.&nbsp; Think of it as 'auto-complete'
            or 'intellisense' for calls.&nbsp; This is a priority to develop.</li>
        <li>More designations.&nbsp; This release reworked the parsing of ANYONE phrases so
            that 'beaus' and 'belles' now are marked as A-1 terms.&nbsp; These changes also
            made it much easier to add new phrases.&nbsp; For this release, for example, the
            following new phrases are now recognized:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>lead ANYONE</strong> - designates dancers who are leaders as well as the
            following ANYONE phrase.&nbsp; For example: 'lead girls', 'lead ends'.</li>
        <li><strong>end ANYONE</strong> - designates dancers who are ends in the current formation
            as well as the following ANYONE phrase.&nbsp; For example: 'end boys', 'end heads'.</li>
        <li><strong>center ANYONE</strong> - designates dancers who are centers in the current
            formation as well as the following ANYONE phrase.&nbsp; For example: 'center beaus'.
            </li>
    </ul>
        Obviously, many more such phrases need to be added.&nbsp;</li><li>More calls.&nbsp; The Plus level is up next.</li></ol>
    <h3>
        Features Added</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The Mainstream list has been added to the definitions.</li>
        <li>A Formation Editor has been added.&nbsp; Now when you expand the Formations section
            of a grammar and click on a formation name, a Formation Editor will be brought up
            in the right-hand sub-window.</li>
        <li>Formation diagrams have been added to the definitions.&nbsp; Each valid formation
            pattern will include the formation to its right.</li>
        <li>There is now a button to delete a part of a definition variant.</li>
        <li>Buttons have been added to variants to move them up or down within the definition.</li>
        <li>Preferences have been added to give you control of the layout of a printed sequence.&nbsp;
            You can set the various margins and fonts on the preferences page now and they will
            apply to the next printing (and will be retained until you change them again).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Known Bugs</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Four-dancer stars are not supported.</li>
        <li>Two ladies chain 3/4 cannot be expressed.</li>
        <li>Couples are not defined for infacing rings, when boy-girl arrangements should be
            able to do couple-based calls. </li>
        <li>From a squared set, the call 'turn your partner by the left 1/2' does not produce
            a thar.&nbsp; It should.</li>
        <li>From a quarter tag, calling "centers cast off 3/4' does not yield a proper 2x4 arrangement.&nbsp;
            It should.</li>
        <li>Dancers move through one another without collision.&nbsp; This is also impossible.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Bugs Fixed</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Scrollbars did not work properly if the section was too small.&nbsp; Essentially
            clicking on the scrollbars would be interpreted as clicking on the enclosed window
            instead.</li>
        <li>Editing sequences could end up causing your typing to double, triple or even more,
            sssooo aaa ppphhhrrraaassseee lllooooookkkeeeddd llliiikkkeee ttthhhiiisss.</li>
        <li>Typos or otherwise malformed calls entered in the Sequence Editor could crash the
            program.&nbsp; This was somewhat unpredictable.&nbsp; Error recovery when parsing
            is now handled correctly.</li>
        <li>If you edited a long definition that required scrolling, the scroll bars would reset
            after each change.&nbsp; They are preserved now.</li>
        <li>Column circulates did not work.&nbsp; All dancers always stepped forward, even the
            leads of the columns.</li>
        <li>The call 'ends circulate' for parallel lines did not work.&nbsp; It has been added.</li>
        <li>The call 'promenade home' from left-hand two-faced lines was not recognized.&nbsp;
            It has been added.</li>
        <li>Fractionalizing some calls was not working.&nbsp; This included things like 'split
            circulate 1 and 1/2'.</li>
        <li>You can now close and re-open dance files as many times as you like.</li>
        <li>You can now place empty lines in a sequence without interfering with the animation.</li>
        <li>Beaus and belles are now restricted to A-1 and above.</li>
        <li>A number of situations caused the generated motions of the dancers to be incorrect.&nbsp;
            At least eight different bugs fell into this category and a detailed explanation
            of all of them is not worth the space.&nbsp; At this point, all known issues with
            calls succeeding, but producing dis-continuous motion are fixed.</li>
    </ol>

        &nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        Alpha-1 Release Notes- May 16, 2010</h2>
    <p>
        This is the first public release of <em>Sets in Motion</em>.&nbsp; Using a relatively
        standard terminology, this is an Alpha-quality release.&nbsp; This means that some
        key features (like formation viewing/editing) are missing, and other functions (printer
        formatting) are incomplete.&nbsp; The program has been tested, so most features
        that are documented are available and will likely work correctly.&nbsp; Calls may
        have significant bugs in their definitions.&nbsp; In particular, the starting formation
        may be incomplete or the existing definition language may not work correctly for
        some starting formations.</p>
    <p>
        As soon as I deliver this version, I will begin working on the next, more mature
        release.&nbsp; I plan on releasing several updates before calling this an officially
        released product.&nbsp; Until then, expect to see occasional new updates.&nbsp;
        I will be setting up a Web-site to make checking for and getting updates possible.&nbsp;
        For now, this package is being distributed via e-mail to specific individuals.</p>
    <h2>
        Feedback Needed</h2>
    <p>
        I am interested in getting broad feedback on how the major components of the user
        interface flow together.&nbsp; Does it make sense to you when shifting from editing
        a sequence to using the animation or call analyzer.&nbsp; Are the labels on buttons
        clear?&nbsp; Are there key features that you need that do not appear in the program.&nbsp;
        I have my own ideas about the future direction of the program and have hinted at
        future features in places.&nbsp; I do not want to bias you, however, so I have refrained
        from much prognostication.&nbsp; I really want to know what you think would be useful
        (hopefully to most users).</p>
    <p>
        Is the help text accurate and useful?&nbsp; Do I need more detailed discussion of
        the program controls and displays?&nbsp; Are the essays in the Caller's Guide helpful
        or confusing?&nbsp; What topics would you have liked to see, but are missing?</p>
    <p>
        Most importantly, try composing some sequences.&nbsp; So far, the Basic list is
        pretty completely implemented.&nbsp; I don't expect you to write much material but
        anything you could do to identify wrong or missing call variations will be very
        useful.</p>
    <p>
        At this stage, the definitions and primitives are not thoroughly documented, so
        I would be amazed if you could figure out how to do more than minor tweeks.&nbsp;
        The definition language is pretty unexpressive currently, so many more advanced
        concepts are simply impossible to express.</p>
    <p>
        If you have any feedback or questions, e-mail me at <strong>bjervis@gmail.com</strong>.&nbsp;
        Please check the following list of known issues before reporting anything.&nbsp;
        When in doubt, report a problem.&nbsp; In particular, none of the known issues cause
        the program to crash or lock up indefinitely.&nbsp; The program should be responsive
        no matter what.&nbsp; If you see any of these severe failures, please let me know
        about it.</p>
    <p>
        The program should not corrupt your data.&nbsp; Definitely let me know if you think
        you have saved something and it does not reload properly.&nbsp; If your machine
        crashes while the program is writing data, I can't make any guarantees.&nbsp; In
        general, the program will create a backup copy of any file before it tries to save
        a new copy, but there is no automated way to recover these backups.&nbsp; If you
        think you have a corrupted file, do not save again.&nbsp; That will destroy the
        backup.&nbsp; Contact me if you need help finding and restoring the backup files.</p>
    <h2>
        Known Bugs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Four-dancer stars are not supported.</li>
        <li>Two ladies chain 3/4 cannot be expressed.</li>
        <li>Beaus and belles are not restricted to Advanced and above.</li>
        <li>Closing a dance-file editor and re-opening it does not work correctly.&nbsp; The
            file is locked out until you restart the program.&nbsp; (You can close and re-open
            the My Library, Definitions and My Definitions files correctly.)</li>
        <li>If you have a blank line in a sequence, the animation playback will 'get stuck'
            at the blank.&nbsp; You will see the timer move forward and eventually stop, but
            the dancers freeze at the position of the blank line and then instantaneously jump
            to the final position when the animation completes.</li>
