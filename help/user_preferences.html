<h1>Preferences</h1>
    <p>
        The sub-window that allows you to view and modify a variety of program parameters
        is called the Preferences view.&nbsp; It will appear in the right-hand pane of the
        main window.</p>
<img src=preferences_sample.png />
    <p>The image above shows the appearance
        of the preferences view.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
        Any
        value that you change either in the Preferences view or wherever else it appears
        in the program will be stored immediately to disk.&nbsp; You never have to explicitly
        save preference values, nor is there any notion of undoing them.&nbsp; If you are
        ever unsure of their current setting, a quick look at the Preferences view is designed
        to let you know what their values currently.</p>
    <p>
        The Animation speed is the same set of speed buttons that appears in the Animator.&nbsp;
        The selected speed varies where Slowest is about half the speed of Normal speed
        and Fastest is about twice as fast as Normal.&nbsp; The other values are in between.</p>
    <p>
        The two Allow editing' check boxes correspond to locking or unlocking the respective
        Definitions files.</p>
    <p>
        The various font settings control how the text of sequences appear either in the
        Performance Window or when printed on paper.&nbsp; Currently there is no way to
        control the fonts or text size in the main window.</p>
    <p>
        For each font, you may choose the font family from a menu, but if you have too many
        fonts, the list will extend past the bottom of your screen and there is no way to
        scroll it currently.</p>
    <p>
        A sample of each font is printed to the right, using the various settings as you
        have entered them.</p>
    <p>
        Finally in the very bottom of the Preferences pane is a distorted mockup of a piece
        of paper.&nbsp; The upper grey area is the header space of the page and the lower
        grey area is the body of the sequence on a page.&nbsp; The various margins identified
        govern how a sequence is positioned relative to the edges of the paper or in the
        case of the header margin, the edges of the respective text areas on the page.&nbsp;
        Note that the units default to inches, but that field is selectable.</p>
    <p>
        Use the Windows printer dialog to adjust settings such as paper size for your printer.&nbsp;
        Margins are computed based on the selected paper size.</p>
    <p>
        Currently, there are no preference settings for text color.</p>
