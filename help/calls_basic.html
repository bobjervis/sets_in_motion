<TITLE>Sets in Motion: Basic Calls</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<h1>Callerlab Basic Level Calls</h1>
    <p>
        These calls are organized by the Callerlab call names and numbering, using the Callerlab
        Basic and Mainstream Definitions document dated November 1, 2009.</p>
    <p>
        Sections are included below for each call, even if there is nothing said in that
        section.&nbsp; If nothing is said, then the call should work as you would expect.</p>
    <h3>
        1. Circle Left / Circle Right</h3>
    <h4>
        1.a.: 8 Dancers</h4>
    <p>
        If you do not specify a fraction to circle, dancers are to move until the caller
        gives them something else to do.&nbsp; In the program, it picks about 3 dancer positions
        worth of movement and stops there.&nbsp; It also positions the dancers off just
        a little so that if you start moving the dancers into thars, or have someone move
        in so that you gets waves, columns or any other common formation it will not be
        square to the walls not matter how hard you try.&nbsp; The only way to get the dancers
        back to truly squared positions is to have the dancers circle or promenade home.</p>
    <p>
        Real dancers will usually align themselves to walls pretty quickly, just because
        it is so much easier to keep the formations straight.&nbsp; As a caller, though,
        you need to be aware that just because your dancers squared up, you can't rely on
        such phrases as "head positions" or "those facing side walls" to identify dancers
        until you get them home again.</p>
    <h4>
        1.b.: 4 Dancers</h4>
    <p>
        You must specify a fraction when having 4 dancers circle, and the circle can only
        turn in 1/4 multiples.&nbsp; While <em>Sets in Motion</em> supports moving the whole
        set out of alignment with the walls, it will not allow you to move some of the dancers
        out of alignment while leaving other dancers aligned.</p>
    <h4>
        1.c: 2 Dancers</h4>
    <p>
        The phrasing "single circle (left/right) FRACTION" is recognized as a 2 dancer circle
        move.&nbsp; Some callers consider this improper.&nbsp; If you have a preferred phrasing,
        you will have to enter your own definition.</p>
    <h3>
        2. Forward and Back</h3>
    <h3>
        3. Dosado / Dosado to a Wave</h3>
    <h4>
        3.a.: Dosado</h4>
    <p>
        This is written as a 4 part call.</p>
    <h4>
        3.b: Dosado to a Wave</h4>
    <p>
        This call cannot be fractionalized.</p>
    <h3>
        4. Swing</h3>
    <p>
        You must write this call as "swing your partner" or "swing your corner".&nbsp; The
        single word call "swing" is an Adanvced level call.</p>
    <p>
        This call always ends in dancers facing promenade direction (contrary to the Callerlab
        definition).&nbsp; You must add something like "promenade 0/4" to get the dancers
        to face in.</p>
    <h3>
        5. Promenade Family</h3>
    <h4>
        5.a.: Couples</h4>
    <p>
        The Callerlab definition lists a set of starting formations, but promenade is often
        called from slightly different formations than just the ones given.&nbsp; The definition
        in <em>Sets in </em>Motion will try the call from any 2x4 formation, for example,
        which is not included in the Callerlab definitions.&nbsp; Note that a couples promenade
        might not work from many 2x4 starting positions, so the program may fail because
        some later step in the call cannot be done.</p>
    <h4>
        5.b.: Single file Promenade</h4>
    <h4>
        5.c.: Wrong Way Promenade</h4>
    <h4>
        5.d.: Star Promenade</h4>
    <h3>
        6. Allemande Left</h3>
    <p>
        Contrary to the name, this definition includes "Allemande Right".</p>
    <h3>
        7. Arm Turns</h3>
    <h3>
        8. Right and Left Grand Family</h3>
    <h4>
        8.a: Right and Left Grand</h4>
    <h4>
        8.b: Weave the Ring</h4>
    <h4>
        8.c: Wrong Way Grand</h4>
    <h3>
        9. Left-Hand Start / Right-Hand Star</h3>
    <p>
        Eight person stars are supported, but four person stars are not. &nbsp;Four person
        stars are not currently supported.&nbsp; Four person star choreography is generally
        limited to singing calls and seems highly directional (the dancers do not star specific
        fractions and adjust to be square to the other dancers as needed by the following
        calls), all of which makes it very difficult for this program to handle the call.</p>
    <h3>
        10. Pass Thru</h3>
    <p>
        The current animation for this call has the dancers literally passing thru one another.&nbsp;
        Clearly few real dancers will do this for you.</p>
    <h3>
        11. Half Sashay</h3>
    <h4>
        11.a: Half Sashay</h4>
    <p>
        You cannot use the shortened "sashay" for this call.</p>
    <p>
        This is defined as a 2 part call, so you can write "1/2 half sashay" or even "1/2
        1/2 sashay".</p>
    <h4>
        11.b: Rollaway</h4>
    <p>
        You must use the single word "rollaway" for this call.</p>
    <p>
        This is defined as a 2 part call, so you can write "1/2 rollaway".</p>
    <h4>
        11.c: Ladies in, men sashay</h4>
    <p>
        This is defined in the program as "ANYONE in, ANYONE sashay", so you are not restricted
        to the identities of the dancers doing each part.&nbsp; The examples in the Callerlab
        definition makes it clear that this is the intention.</p>
    <h3>
        12. Turn Back family</h3>
    <h4>
        12.a: U-turn Back</h4>
    <h4>
        12.b: Backtrack</h4>
    <h3>
        13. Separate</h3>
    <h4>
        13.a: Around 1 or 2 to a line</h4>
    <h4>
        13.b: Around 1 or 2 and into the middle</h4>
    <h3>
        14. Split Two</h3>
    <h3>
        15. Courtesy Turn</h3>
    <p>
        This is implemented as a 180&deg; turn except from a right-hand two-face line where
        it is a 3/4 turn.&nbsp; Callerlab clearly says that the turn should continue until
        the couples are facing into the set.&nbsp; This says that "courtesy turn" from dancers
        at home would have them turn a full 360&deg; around!&nbsp; <em>Sets in Motion</em>
        will just turn half way.</p>
    <h3>
        16. Ladies Chain Family</h3>
    <h4>
        16.a: Two ladies chain</h4>
    <h4>
        16.b: Four ladies chain</h4>
    <p>
        Ladies chain 3/4 is included under this definition.&nbsp; The current Callerlab
        document mentions both 2 and four ladies chain here, but the definition really only
        describes 4 laides chain 3/4.&nbsp; <em>Sets in Motion</em> currently does not let
        you name just two ladies, so 2 ladies chain 3/4 cannot be called currently.&nbsp;
        Since there is no usable Callerlab definition for this call variation, even when
        that capablility is added, you will not be able to call this until a proper definition
        is entered for it.</p>
    <h4>
        16.c: Chain down the line</h4>
    <h3>
        17. Do Paso</h3>
    <p>
        This call has no definite ending formation and may include a final courtesy turn.&nbsp;
        It isn't entirely clear from the definition when to do the courtesy turn and the
        current definition never does so.</p>
    <h3>
        18. Lead Right</h3>
    <h3>
        19. Veer Left / Veer Right</h3>
    <h3>
        20. Bend the Line</h3>
    <h3>
        21. Circulate Family</h3>
    <h3>
        22. Right and Left Thru</h3>
    <h3>
        23. Grand Square</h3>
    <p>
        This definition is described in terms of 'steps' (a total of 32 in all), and when
        it is fractionalized callers say things like "grand square 12 steps".&nbsp; The
        <em>Sets in Motion</em> definition is written as an 8 part call and there does not
        appear any way to provide a precise 32 part definition.&nbsp; Each part in the program
        definition implements four steps in the original definition, one of which is a face
        in.&nbsp; However, the other three steps are intended to move the dancer 1 full
        position forward or backward.&nbsp; When you examine how the dancers must move to
        make this call work properly, each forward or backward 'step' must move them 1/3
        of a position.</p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the definition of "grand square INTEGER steps" in the program converts
        this to "N/32 grand square".&nbsp; So, "grand square 12 steps" becomes "3/8 grand
        square".&nbsp; In effect, this definition will only allow you to use numbers of
        steps that are multiples of 4.</p>
    <h3>
        24. Star Thru</h3>
    <h3>
        25. Circle to a Line</h3>
    <p>
        The Callerlab definition discusses styling only for normal boy-girl couples, even
        though the description of the dance action is more positional.&nbsp; The program
        definition is strictly positional.&nbsp; The final dancer in the line turns out,
        but <em>Sets in Motion</em> does not animate hand styling.&nbsp; How same-sex or
        sashayed couples would complete this part of the call is left open.</p>
    <h3>
        26. Walk Around the Corner</h3>
    <h3>
        27. See Saw</h3>
    <p>
        The callerlab definition states that this call should only be used in conjunction
        with Walk Around the Corner.&nbsp; <em>Sets in Motion</em> does not enforce this
        restriction.</p>
    <h3>
        28. Square Thru (1,2,3,4) / Left Square Thru (1,2,3,4)</h3>
    <p>
        The program definition allows square thru amounts greater than 4.</p>
    <h3>
        29. California Twirl</h3>
    <h3>
        30. Dive Thru</h3>
    <p>
        In order to use "dive thru" from anything other than an eight-chain
        thru position, you must designate the dancers who will 'dive' (go through the arch
        formed by the other facing couple), as in "heads dive thru".</p>
    <h3>
        31. Wheel Around</h3>
    <h3>
        32. Thar Family</h3>
    <h3>
        33. Shoot the Star / Shoot the Star Full Around</h3>
    <h3>
        34. Slip the Clutch</h3>
    <h3>
        35. Box the Gnat</h3>
    <h3>

    <h3>
        37. Ocean Wave Family</h3>
    <h3>

    <h3>
        39. Swing Thru / Left Swing Thru</h3>
    <h3>
        40. Run / Cross Run</h3>
    <h3>
        41. Pass the Ocean</h3>
    <h3>
        42. Extend (from 1/4 Tag only)</h3>
    <h3>
        43. Wheel And Deal</h3>
    <h3>
        44. Double Pass Thru</h3>
    <h3>
        45. First Couple Go Left/Right, Next Couple Go Left/Right</h3>
    <h3>
        46. Zoom</h3>
    <h3>
        47. Flutterwheel / Reverse Flutterwheel</h3>
    <h3>
        48. Sweep a Quarter</h3>
    <p>
        The Callerlab definition describes "Sweep a Quarter" in terms of left or right body
        flow.&nbsp; The program definition tries to define this in terms of any curving
        motion whose radius is greater than zero.&nbsp; The zero-radius exclusion eliminates simple
        facing turns, such as a "roll".&nbsp; It also requires that all dancers share this
        same motion.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
        Traditionally, callers have called "Sweep a 1/4" after a wave "Recycle" and dancers
        have no trouble doing the call.&nbsp; However, after carefully reviewing both the Mainstream and Challenge definition
        for "Recycle", it would appear that you cannot call "Sweep a Quarter" after a recycle
        from a wave.&nbsp; In the Mainstream definition the original centers final action
        is to face in and in the Challenge definition, the final action is a roll for all
        dancers.</p>
    <p>
        The program definition currently disallows "Sweep a Quarter" after a wave "Recycle".</p>
    <h3>
        49. Trade By</h3>
    <h3>
        50. Touch 1/4</h3>
    <p>
        The program definition allows no fraction or any fraction that involves an even
        number of 1/4 turns.&nbsp; The call "touch" is the same as "step to a wave".</p>
    <h3>
        51. Ferris Wheel</h3>
